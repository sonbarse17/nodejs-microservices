# Service 2 Documentation

## Overview
Service 2 is a microservice that handles specific business logic and interacts with a Redis database for caching and data storage. It is designed to be lightweight and efficient, providing RESTful APIs for the frontend application.

## Features
- RESTful API endpoints for managing resources.
- Integration with Redis for fast data retrieval and caching.
- Scalable architecture to support multiple instances.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 14 or higher)
- Redis server

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the service2 directory:
   ```
   cd services/service2
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

### Running the Service
To start the service, run:
```
npm start
```

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/resource`: Retrieve a list of resources.
- `POST /api/resource`: Create a new resource.
- `GET /api/resource/:id`: Retrieve a specific resource by ID.
- `PUT /api/resource/:id`: Update a specific resource by ID.
- `DELETE /api/resource/:id`: Delete a specific resource by ID.

## Redis Integration
Service 2 uses Redis for caching frequently accessed data to improve performance. Ensure that the Redis server is running before starting the service.
